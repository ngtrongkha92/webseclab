## Command Injection
Command injection is a technique, which allows an attacker to execute system commands by abusing an application feature. The injection typically occurs when the developer is using user input to construct an executable command specific to the pseudo system shell in use.

## Remote Code Injection

Remote Code Injection is a vulnerability, which allows an attacker to remotely inject code into an application in order to change its execution flow. The issue typically occurs due to the fact that the application is written in a language, which allows dynamic evaluation of code at runtime.


## SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a code injection technique, which exploits a security vulnerability occurring in the database layer of a web application. The vulnerability is present when user input is incorrectly filtered for special characters embedded in a SQL statement and thereby unexpectedly executed, i.e. the input was injected into the SQL statement issued by the web application.

## Remote File Include

A Remote File Include is a vulnerability, which allows attackers to manipulate the application in order to include a remote file hosted on a 3rd-party server. This file may be executable, typically written in a scripting language.
